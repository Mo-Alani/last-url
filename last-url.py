# A simple script to find the redirection history of a URL
# This can be useful in finding the ultimate URL after redirection to avoid pishing URLs
# Script created by Mohammed M. Alani (m@alani.me)
# The script is designed to run from the command line followed by the URL, or -h URL.
# The URL alone without -h would should you the last URL after redirection, and -h would show you the whol redirect history.
# Example:
# python last-url.py -h http://www.mohammedalani.com
